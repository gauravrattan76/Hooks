React Hooks-
_____________________________________


Hooks  are a new feature added in react version 16.8 which allow you to use react features without having to write class.

ex. State of a component


Hooks can’t be used inside a class.

Why we needed Hooks-

Reason 1-1. To work with classes we have to understand how this keyword works in javascript, hence struggle to implement class component.
2.Remember to bind event handles in class component.
3.class don’t minify well and make hot reloading very un reliable.


Reason 2-

No particular way to reuse the stateful component logic.
HOC and render props patterns address the problem.
Makes the code harder to follow.
There is a need to share stateful logic in a better way.


Reason 3-

Organise the logic inside a component into reusable  isolated units.
